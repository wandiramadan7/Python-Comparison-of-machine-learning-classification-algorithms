# Python-Comparison-of-machine-learning-classification-algorithms
Hello everyone,
This time I will share the results of my project on the comparison of machine learning classification algorithms. 
In this project, I classified the survival of cirrhosis patients. Cirrhosis occurs due to prolonged liver damage, leading to extensive scarring, 
often caused by conditions such as hepatitis or chronic alcohol consumption. The data provided is sourced from the Mayo Clinic's study on primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted from 1974 to 1984. 
There are 18 features involved, and the target is the survival status, including 0 = D (death), 1 = C (censored), 2 = CL (censored due to liver transplant).
I involved 16 classification algorithms:
1. Cat Boost	
2. Logistic Regression	
3. Gradient Boosting Classifier	
4. SVM RBF C 100	
5. Random Forest Classifier	
6. Extra Trees Classifier	
7. SVM Linear C `10000	
8. XgBoost	
9. Light Gradient Boosting Machine
10. Naive Bayes	
11. SVM Poly C 100	
12. KNN	
13. Ada Boost Classifier	
14. Decision Tree Classifier	
15. SVM Sigmoid	
16. Neural Network	

Out of the 16 algorithms, the CatBoost Classifier has the highest accuracy, which is 0.777778.n this project, I believe the accuracy can still be improved by adjusting the most optimal parameters and the features involved.

Thanks,
Wandi Ramadan
